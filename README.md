🩺 Diabetes Prediction & Medicine Recommendation System (ANN + GUI)

This project is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)–based Diabetes Prediction System built using Python, TensorFlow (Keras), Scikit-learn, and Tkinter GUI.

The application predicts the probability of diabetes based on patient health parameters such as Glucose, BMI, Age, and Blood Pressure, and provides a rule-based medicine suggestion for academic and learning purposes.
